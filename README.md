Some of my learnings + takeaways during 6 weeks stay at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf (Freiberg, Germany)

This is a readme doc which explains what files are inside this repo.

1. HIF Discussion 1 and HIF Discussion 2: presentations files during my discussion, mainly about ideas and preliminary results

2. 2 pdf files (w Raimon + Sangga): handwritten notes that I took during our talk, Sangga is a PhD student who works on improving geostatistical interpolation for tailings bodies

3. Python + Jupyter folder: working model for Kriging (spatial interpolation method) on hypothetical tailings dataset (dataset from Sangga)

4. dataset SgeMs: Another Kriging spatial interpolation, this time using a specific open-source software (Stanford geostatistical modelling -- http://sgems.sourceforge.net/) for geostatistical modelling

5. HSC Sim simulations: some tests and use cases of metallurgical process on HSC SIM Outotec's proprietary software -- https://www.outotec.com/products-and-services/technologies/digital-solutions/hsc-chemistry/hsc-sim-process-simulation-module/
